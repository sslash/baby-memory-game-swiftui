## TODOS
Tiny popup when chosen the correct card
Popup when finished
Ability to upload items instead of manually adding in code


## Add new cards
- download movies into a new folder
- cd into folder
- ll then copy output to vs code, then compress: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec h264 -acodec aac output.mp4`
- give correct names to each file
- Do the same vscode thing and create thumbnails from the videos by: `ffmpeg -i huske.mp4 -ss 00:00:01.000 -vframes 1 output.png`
- Remove unused uncompressed video files
